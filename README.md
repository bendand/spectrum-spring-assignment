This is my solution for the Jr. Spectrum WebAPI developer coding challenge.
I used a single endpoint located in com.example.spectrum_webapi/controllers/RewardsController to demonstrate the functionality of the API
The endpoint contains a GET method that returns a list of rewards based on the user's points
The data is hardcoded for demonstration purposes, but in a real-world scenario, it would be fetched from a database
